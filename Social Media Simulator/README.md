# Project #: TextBook

* Author: Hector Mendez-Garcia
* Class: CS121 Section #
* Semester: Spring 2023

## Overview

TextBook is a console-based social media platform allowing one user at a time to add, remove, comment on, and display posts. The state is saved in files for future use. Upon running, users enter their username and access a menu to perform desired actions.

## Reflection

What worked well for me was the clear specification provided in the prompt, which helped me understand 
the requirements of the project. However, I struggled with implementing some of the features 
particularly the ability to display all posts and their associated comments.The concepts that aren't 
quite clear to me yet are file I/O and exception handling. Although I was able to get the basic 
functionality of reading and writing to files working, I still feel like there is more to learn in these 
areas.

To make my code easy to debug and modify, I used comments to explain what each 
part of my code was doing and made sure to use descriptive variable names. I also made sure to break 
down my code into small, manageable functions that were easy to test individually.If I could go back in 
time, I would tell myself to spend more time on the design process. I found myself making changes to my 
code structure and data structures as I implemented new features, which made my code more difficult to 
work with. In the future, I would try to spend more time planning out the structure of my code before I 
start coding.

## Compiling and Using

When the program is run, the user will be prompted to enter their username. 
Once they have entered their username, they will be presented with a menu of options to choose from, 
including adding a post, commenting on a post, deleting a post, displaying all posts, and selecting a 
post to read with all its associated comments. If the user selects an option that requires additional 
input, such as adding a post or commenting on a post, they will be prompted to enter the desired 
information.
